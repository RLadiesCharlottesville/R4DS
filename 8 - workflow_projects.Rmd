## Projects

From [8. Workflow: Projects](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

*Ch. 6 in the book*

- Code should be saved in scripts, not just in your environment
- RStudio shows your current working directory at the top of the console *(I always forget this!)*
- never use absolute paths in your scripts (EX. C:), because they hinder sharing
- keep all the files associated with a project together â€” input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures -- and keep it in the appropriate subdirectory
- when you click on an `.Rproj` file, you'll openthe same working directory, command history, and all the files you were working on that were saved to that project but with a fresh environment

There are no practice question for this section. 

*Adios!*
