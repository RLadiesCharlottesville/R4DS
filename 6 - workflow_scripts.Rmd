## Scripts

From [6. Workflows: Scripts](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html)

*Ch. 4 in the book*

- execute the complete script in one step: `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `S`
- never include `install.packages()` or `setwd()` in a script that you share. Itâ€™s very antisocial to change settings on someone elseâ€™s computer!

### Practice

**1. Go to the RStudio Tips twitter account, https://twitter.com/rstudiotips and find one tip that looks interesting. Practice using it!**

**2. What other common mistakes will RStudio diagnostics report? Read https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205753617-Code-Diagnostics to find out.**

**Answer**: Some other mistakes that RStudio diagnostics will report are:

- missing arguments, unmatched arguments, partially matched arguments, and too many arguments
- extra or missing commas
- warn if a symbol is used with no definition in the scope - might ask if it's a typo of something similar
- warn if variable is defined but not used
- style diagnostic checks to see if your code conforms to [Hadley Wickhamâ€™s style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), and reports style warnings when encountered, esp. whitespace
